You want to project an image of a champion for the environment without putting any effort to actually save the environment. You want to be perceived by your friends as a warrior for the environment without actually doing anything. You support environmental action paid by others. You face too much competition from virtue signalers who are better than you and have hard time to stay on top. Let's face it, the competition out there is brutal. You are frequently shamed by more virtuous environmentalists and you lack the ability to defend yourself.  If any of these points resonate with you, join the silent majority and become a master environmentalist in the eyes of your peers.\n","href":"/about/","title":"About"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/features/","title":"features"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/i18n/","title":"i18n"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/muniftanjim/","title":"muniftanjim"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/translation/","title":"translation"},{"content":"You can translate Minimo in your own language!\nFor example, if you want to translate Minimo in Spanish, you will have to add this to your site's config file:\n[languages.es] lang = \u0026#34;es\u0026#34; languageName = \u0026#34;Spanish\u0026#34; weight = 1 Then create a folder named /i18n/ in your site's root.
