You want to project an image of a champion for the environment without putting any effort to actually save the environment. You long to be perceived by your friends as a warrior for the environment without sacrificing anything. You support environmental action only if paid by others. You feel that environmentalism is going too far or does not make sense, when the environmentalism imposes inconvenience for you.

My favorite arguments always work:\n But what about the children? How could you possibly deny a smile on child's face? Besides, a little sugar once in a while cannot hurt! Are you being culturally insensitive? These are centuries old traditions that need to be preserved and nurtured!  Uff, that one was a close one! But with a proper use of defenses in our toolbox (soon to be published), you can easily defend yourself.\nFacts  Mexico produces dozens of thousands piñatas each year. While in the past they were made out of pottery and paper (environmentally degradable materials), today they use mostly plastic for decoration. Mexico recycles only 3.3% of its garbage. Most of the piñata garbage ends up in landfills poisoning the environment with microplastics which end up in the food chain. Piñata custom encourages children to consume candy and develops their sugar addiction at an early age.
