 You care about the environment, but you are too important to adjust your living standards or the way you go about your life.

      <description>You can translate Minimo in your own language!
For example, if you want to translate Minimo in Spanish, you will have to add this to your site&#39;s config file:
[languages.es] lang = &amp;#34;es&amp;#34; languageName = &amp;#34;Spanish&amp;#34; weight = 1 Then create a folder named /i18n/ in your site&#39;s root. And create a file /i18n/es.toml with the translated strings.
For reference template you can see the en.toml file.
If you want your translation file to be included in Minimo repository, feel free to create a pull request.</description>
