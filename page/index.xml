      <description>This blog is for you, the silent majority who has no voice:
 You care about the environment, but you are too important to adjust your living standards or the way you go about your life. You want to project an image of a champion for the environment without putting any effort to actually save the environment. You long to be perceived by your friends as a warrior for the environment without sacrificing anything.</description>
